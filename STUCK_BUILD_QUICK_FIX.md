# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX: Stuck Build on Oracle Cloud

## What's Happening?
Your Swift compilation is stuck because Oracle Cloud's free tier (1GB RAM) doesn't have enough memory for the build process.

## üöÄ Quick Fix (Run These Commands Now)

### Step 1: Stop the stuck process
```bash
# SSH to your server and run:
cd /opt/spjin
docker-compose down
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker system prune -f
```

### Step 2: Add swap space (essential!)
```bash
# Create 2GB swap file
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Verify swap is active
free -h
```

### Step 3: Use the automated fix
```bash
# Make the fix script executable and run it
chmod +x deploy/fix-stuck-build.sh
./deploy/fix-stuck-build.sh
```

### Step 4: Alternative manual fix
```bash
# If you prefer manual control:
# Copy the low-memory Dockerfile
cp Dockerfile Dockerfile.original
cp Dockerfile.lowmem Dockerfile

# Build with memory limits
export COMPOSE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=3600
docker-compose build --no-cache --memory=1g
docker-compose up -d
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Time
- With swap space: 15-30 minutes
- Without optimization: May fail or take hours

## üéØ Success Indicators
```bash
# Check if it's working:
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## üìä Monitor Progress
```bash
# Watch memory usage
watch -n 5 'free -h && docker stats --no-stream'

# Watch build logs
docker-compose logs -f spjin-app
```

## üö® If Still Stuck
1. **Increase VM size temporarily**: Upgrade to 2GB RAM instance for build, then downgrade
2. **Build locally**: Build Docker image on your local machine and push to registry
3. **Use GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD to build and deploy automatically

## üí° Prevention for Next Time
- Always add swap space before building
- Use the low-memory Dockerfile by default
- Build during off-peak hours (less network congestion)

**Run the fix script now and wait patiently! ‚è∞**
